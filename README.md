# odin-recipes
Recipes Project from The Odin Project

This project is a website which hosts a bunch of recipes from all over the
world using HTML.

This is part of my TOP's assignment for honing my skills writing HTML, using
tags, images and links; also getting familiar with git and GitHub.

I'll come back later to this project to work on my CSS skills.
