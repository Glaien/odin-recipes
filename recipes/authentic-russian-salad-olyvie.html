    <h1>Authentic Russian Salad Olyvie</h1>

       looking salad" width="500">
      <p>This is a recipe my mom and grandmother use every time there's a
       family gathering or a special occasion. To make this a vegetarian dish
       just leave out the ham. Potatoes, carrots, and eggs do not have to be
       chilled completely after boiling. Dill can be substituted for parsley if
       desired.</p>
      <h2><em>Ingredients</em></h2>
        <ul>
          <li>6 <strong>potatoes</strong>, peeled</li>
          <li>1 <strong>carrot</strong>, or more to taste</li>
          <li>4 <strong>eggs</strong></li>
          <li>6 large <strong>pickles</strong>, cut into cubes</li>
          <li>1 (15 ounce) can <strong>peas</strong>, drained</li>
          <li>&frac12; cup cubed fully cooked <strong>ham</strong>, or to taste
          </li>
          <li>1 tablespoon chopped fresh <strong>parsley</strong>, or to taste
           (optional)</li>
          <li>&frac12; cup <strong>mayonnaise</strong>, or to taste</li>
        </ul>
      <h2><em>Steps</em></h2>
        <ol>
          <li>Bring a large pot of water to a boil; add potatoes and carrot.
           Return mixture to a boil and add eggs; cook until potatoes are
           tender, 20 to 30 minutes. Drain and slightly cool mixture. Chop
           potatoes and carrot; peel and chop eggs.</li>
          <li>Mix potatoes, carrot, eggs, pickles, peas, ham, and parsley
           together in a large bowl; stir in mayonnaise until salad is evenly
